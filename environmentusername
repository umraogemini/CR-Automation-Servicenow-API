Yes! You can set ServiceNow API username and password as environment variables in Windows Git Bash and use them with Terraform. 🚀🔒

✅ How to Set Environment Variables in Windows Git Bash
Git Bash follows the Linux-style export command for setting environment variables.

🔹 1️⃣ Set Environment Variables Temporarily (Only for Current Session)
Run these commands in Git Bash:

sh
Copy
Edit
export TF_VAR_servicenow_username="your-snow-username"
export TF_VAR_servicenow_password="your-snow-password"
🔹 These variables will be available only until you close Git Bash.

🔹 2️⃣ Set Environment Variables Permanently (System-Wide)
To make these environment variables persistent across reboots, follow these steps:

A. Add to Windows System Environment Variables
Open Command Prompt (cmd.exe) and run:

cmd
Copy
Edit
setx TF_VAR_servicenow_username "your-snow-username"
setx TF_VAR_servicenow_password "your-snow-password"
Close and reopen Git Bash to apply the changes.

B. Add to Git Bash Profile (.bashrc or .bash_profile)
Open Git Bash and edit the .bashrc file:

sh
Copy
Edit
nano ~/.bashrc
Add these lines at the end of the file:

sh
Copy
Edit
export TF_VAR_servicenow_username="your-snow-username"
export TF_VAR_servicenow_password="your-snow-password"
Save and exit (CTRL + X, then Y, then Enter).

Reload the file to apply changes:

sh
Copy
Edit
source ~/.bashrc
✔ Now, every time you open Git Bash, the variables will be set automatically.

🔥 Verifying Environment Variables
After setting the variables, verify them in Git Bash:

sh
Copy
Edit
echo $TF_VAR_servicenow_username
echo $TF_VAR_servicenow_password
🚀 If Terraform picks them up, you’re all set! Need help with anything else? 😃
