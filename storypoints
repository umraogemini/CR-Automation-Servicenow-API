Sure, UmRao! Here's a breakdown of Agile story points for this Terraform-based ServiceNow CR automation project. I'm assigning story points (SP) using the Fibonacci scale: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc., based on complexity, effort, and time required.

🔧 1. Setup Terraform Project Structure – SP: 2
Creating a modular structure (modules/, main.tf, variables.tf, etc.)

Ensures maintainability and reusability.

🔐 2. Configure ServiceNow Provider – SP: 2
Setting up providers.tf to authenticate against ServiceNow.

Handling sensitive credentials using variables and env vars.

📦 3. Setup Remote Backend (S3) – SP: 3
Define backend.tf for storing the Terraform state securely.

Configuration requires IAM permissions and proper setup.

🧮 4. Define Global and Module Variables – SP: 2
Includes variables.tf and terraform.tfvars for easy customization.

Sensitive values like username/password handled securely.

🔄 5. Create CR Using Terraform Module – SP: 5
Resource creation (servicenow_record) for change_request.

Auto-approves the CR using depends_on.

📤 6. Output CR ID – SP: 1
Outputs CR ID for post-deployment usage and tracking.

🔁 7. Root Module to Call CR Module – SP: 2
Integrate reusable module from main.tf.

Pass variables and capture outputs.

🤖 8. Jenkinsfile for Automation + Notification – SP: 8
Uses Jenkins to:

Inject credentials.

Run Terraform commands.

Query CR status using curl + jq.

Trigger email notification via emailext.

Requires integration between Jenkins and external systems.

🚀 9. GitHub Actions Workflow – SP: 5
Triggers Terraform CR creation on pull_request.

Uses GitHub Secrets to handle ServiceNow credentials.

Ensures CR is automatically created during PR review phase.

📬 10. Email Notification Based on CR State – SP: 5
Parses ServiceNow API response using jq.

Sends conditional email if state is approved.
