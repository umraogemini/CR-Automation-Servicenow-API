üîß General DevOps Questions

1. What is DevOps? How is it different from Agile?


2. What are the key benefits of DevOps?
A.  Faster Delivery and Deployment,Increased Deployment Frequency,Better Stability and Reliability,
Continuous Testing & Integration,Cost Efficiency,Scalability and Flexibility and Better Customer Experience

3. What are the most important DevOps tools you have worked with?
A. Version control :- Github
    CI/CD :- Jenkins
    Containerization :- Dockers, Kubernets
    Infrastruture as code :- Terraform
    Monitoring & Logging :- Prometheus and Grafana, GCP Monitoring

4. What is CI/CD? How have you implemented it?
A.  CI/CD stands for:

CI (Continuous Integration):
The practice of automatically building and testing code whenever developers commit changes to a shared repository. It ensures early detection of bugs and keeps the codebase stable.

CD (Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment):

Continuous Delivery: Automatically prepares code changes for release to staging or production (manual approval for production).

Continuous Deployment: Fully automates the entire release process to production, with no manual steps.

CI/CD Pipeline ‚Äì Real-World Implementation Steps
üü¶ 1. Continuous Integration (CI):
Developers push code to GitHub.

Jenkins is triggered via webhook or polling.

Pipeline stages:

Checkout Code

Build (e.g., Maven/Gradle/npm)

Unit Tests (e.g., JUnit, pytest)

Static Code Analysis (e.g., SonarQube)

Package Artifact (JAR, Docker image)

Output: Docker image pushed to Docker Hub or Nexus.

5. What is the difference between continuous delivery and continuous deployment?
